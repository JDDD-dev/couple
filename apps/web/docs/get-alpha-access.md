# Alpha Access

The first phase in the development of Couple will be the deploy of an Alpha State version of the App in order to find bugs and get feedback about the features and style of the Web App.

The release of the Alpha preview is unknown as currently only me is working on it so be patient pls :/.

## How to get Access

As today the only method for testing the app is by creating an account using Google and contacting me in any of my social accounts linked above providing me your email and I would decide if you can or not test it.

## Give feedback please :cry:

The main purpose of the preview is getting feedback from real world users to improve the design and features. Also be free to advise new features that you would use.
